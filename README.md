# Final-Project-for-CS-1810

I am currently engaged in the development of a multiplayer game as part of my final project for CS-1410. This project revolves around the concept of a combat game involving two players and a variety of heroes, each with unique abilities and backgrounds. As I contemplate the technical aspects of this endeavor, I am considering the utilization of JavaScript for the animation component, particularly within the context of my CS 1810 coursework. My rationale for this decision stems from the belief that leveraging JavaScript would offer superior performance and efficiency compared to alternative frameworks such as Blazor.

By amalgamating both my CS-1410 and CS 1810 projects, I aim to streamline my workload and capitalize on the synergy between the two courses. Opting for JavaScript over Blazor not only aligns with the technical requirements of my multiplayer game but also ensures a more manageable workload. The implementation of JavaScript will primarily focus on animating the heroes and constructing the background environment for the battle scenes. Notable heroes featured in the game include the Viking, Samurai, Assassin of Persia, Spartan, and the Hun warrior. This project, aptly named Empire Kombat, draws inspiration from iconic combat games like Mortal Kombat while offering a unique twist with its array of historically-inspired heroes representing various empires.

In addition to the dynamic gameplay, Empire Kombat will incorporate rich storytelling elements to immerse players in its imaginative world. Each hero will possess a compelling backstory, detailing their origins and motivations for joining the battle. Moreover, the kingdoms in which these confrontations take place will be imbued with intricate lore, shedding light on their history, creators, and overarching purposes. Through this holistic approach to game design, Empire Kombat seeks to deliver an engaging and immersive gaming experience that transcends traditional boundaries.

Project Plan:

Week of April 6:

 Define game concept and mechanics.
 Research JavaScript animation libraries and frameworks.
 Draft initial design for game interface and environment.
 Create a list of required hero characters and their attributes.
 Begin outlining the backstory for each hero and the kingdoms.
 Consult with instructors or peers for feedback on the project scope and feasibility.

Week of April 13:

 Finalize game concept and mechanics based on feedback.
 Select the JavaScript animation library/framework to use.
 Develop a detailed storyboard for game animations and sequences.
 Design initial sketches or wireframes for game interface elements.
 Refine the backstory for hero characters and kingdoms.
 Begin implementing basic functionality for player interactions and character movements.

Week of April 20:

 Implement JavaScript animations for hero characters and background environment.
 Integrate player controls and interactions with the game interface.
 Develop additional game features, such as combat mechanics and special abilities.
 Create and refine visual assets, including character sprites and background images.
 Write scripts for displaying hero backstories and kingdom lore within the game.
 Test the game mechanics and animations for functionality and smoothness.
 
Week of April 27 (Last day of class and due date for final project):

 Finalize all aspects of the game, including graphics, animations, and mechanics.
 Conduct comprehensive testing to identify and resolve any remaining bugs or issues.
 Polish the user interface and experience for optimal gameplay.
